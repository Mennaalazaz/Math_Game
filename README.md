# Math_Game
This program is a math quiz game written in C++ as an example of procedural programming . It allows users to test their math skills by answering arithmetic problems. Users can pick the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, or mixed) and the type of operations they want to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or mixed operations).

The game keeps track of the user's progress throughout the quiz, including the number of questions answered, the chosen difficulty level, and the types of operations used. After each question, the program provides feedback letting the user know if their answer is correct or incorrect. Finally, the program displays a summary of the user's performance at the end of the quiz. The user can then choose to play another round with different settings.
